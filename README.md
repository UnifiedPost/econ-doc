# Euroconnector OpenAPI source code
 - This chapter provides the code samples which could be used while implementing Euroconnector server-side API. 
 - Dedicated only to the Peppol **Access point** (AP) providers.

## API code snippets
 - You can re-use this code 
	 - to define the API methods and describe the request/response data structures
	 - cover some actions with Peppol infrastructure (lookup, validations of the documents)
 - **NOTE:** it does not contain the connection to the AP infrastructure. It should be done individually for the exact AP (data mappings, internal messages and etc.).
 - The UAT version of this API is hosted by the following url: https://euroconnector-uat.unifiedpost.com/api/public/index.html
 
## Alternative API code snippets
 - Open the link https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/euroconnector/econ-def
 - Export the project by choosing: Export >> Server Stub >> {select the programming language}
 - This will help you to define the API methods
